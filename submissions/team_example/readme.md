## Feature engineering description

Here comes a short description of what you have done regarding subsetting, dimensionality reduction, embedding, encoding and generation of new features etc.
You can also provide a list of features that you have used in the end for training your model.

## Training strategy

Here your can briefly describe your validation strategy (cross-validation (CV), repeated CV, ...) and wether you did some kind of hyperparameter optimization etc.

## Model description

Here comes a short description of the model or the model ensemble that you have used.

## Software

Here you can describe the software used for modeling (programming language, libraries/packages, versions).
If you developed your modeling on a code hosting platform like github, you can also put a link to the relevant repository or add your scripts to the submission.


## Estimation of effort

Here we ask you to make an honest :-) estimation of your develompent time, calibration time and time to calculate the predictions for prediction.csv.

| Development time (hrs) | Calibration time (s) |  Prediction time (s) | 
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| ~  X                 | X   | X   |
